# Rating App with Laravel Breeze, Tailwind CSS, Laravel Livewire

In this project we build a rating component using Laravel Livewire. You can click on the stars to give your rating, and both your rating and the average rating of all users is updated and displayed.
The application hosting the rating component is a regular Laravel application that uses Breeze for authentication. Iâ€™m using Tailwind CSS for styling.
